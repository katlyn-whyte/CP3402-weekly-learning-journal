I learn that it is important to test your equip,emt before starting a video recording, 
From recording the practice video this week, I learnt that it is important to test all of your equipment even some you have used before. I had issues with my headphone microphone not working, because of this we wasted time trying to get the microphone working. In the future I will test all of my equipment before I have to record another video, or have a call with someone.
