# Content Insights
While creating a WordPress website, it is vital to be organised and have a plan when beginning the process. The wordflow video was really helpful, as it gave me ideas on what a workflow could look like, and what it could entail.

 # Group Activity Insight
 The group activities were usuful to determine what I value in groups from past experiences. I value peoples work ethic and timliness above most other factors. I did feel like my questions were a little simple, as they could have been refined more.



# Career/employability/Learning Insight
The round robin style of interviews, was very usuful as it showed me that I have to improve my verbal communication skills. I sometimes speak faster then I can comprehend and it all comes out jumbled and incoherent. I also found that I got increasingly more confident in answering questions after a couple of rounds. To improve this I am going to try and talk with different people and participate in more group discussions.
