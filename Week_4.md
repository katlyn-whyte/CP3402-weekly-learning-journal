# Content Insights
This week I had a recap on what version control is an what it entails. Version control is a virtual timeline that provides you with realtime update of the projects you have recently been working on. The recap was good, as it allowed me to remember how to split and merge branches. While reiterating how to write useful commits for my projects.Furthermore, I also learnt about WordPress migration, which is where all of the content on the WordPress website, the settings, themes and plugins and transfer them to a new location. This is done by first setting up a target website, then the plugins, themes and the uploaded files are used. finally the database of the original website will be migrated to the new site.



# Career/employability/Learning Insight
The recap helped me to see that  I do not write myself useful commit messages. As a result of poor messages, I can forget what I have changed in my projects in past iterations, meaning I have to go over all of my project to see what I have to change for the next iterations. To change my process of writing commits, I will be using a template to help improve the usefulness of my commit messages. "This commit will" is the template I will be using to help improve my commits.
