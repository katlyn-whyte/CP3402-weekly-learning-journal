# Content Insights 

This week I learnt the difference between a static website and a CMS website. A static website is manually coded using HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. Each page is a separate file and all updates or changes require manual editing of the code. Whereas, a  CMS website allows users to change and update pages by using an admin interface. The content is stored in a database.

 The video was a good introduction to WordPress, as it gave clear instructions on how the admin interface works. While learning how to edit and create new designs for a website.

The Joomla essential training video was very helpful, as it taught me how to link different pages to the home page using the menu options, as well as adding different attributes to the same category for them to be displayed on the selected pages.


# Career/employability/Learning Insight

When I can not find what I am looking for, I tend too write a long sentence to find what I am searching for, which does not help when searching for specific instructions. This week really helped me with using key words to search for instructions instead of the long sentences. Which did help me to find some instructions from Joomla, a LinkedIn learning video on Joomla and a YouTube video on Joomla website creation.
