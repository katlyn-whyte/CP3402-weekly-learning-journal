Estimated Hours – 3 Hours

Content Insights – 

By watching the videos I revisited the basics of web design with HTML and CSS, where HTML defines structure and CSS adds style. I also had an introduction to JavaScript programming that is used for interactive web development, by making the web pages interactive and dynamic, by providing real time updates and animations for user experience.


Career/Employability/Learning Insights –

 I found watching videos continuously made me very bored, because of this I found it hard to remember what content was just taught. Making me have to rewatch multiple videos. Changing my watch goal to 30 minutes and then practicing what I have just learned, was very beneficial to my learning as I can apply what I just learnt, while also experimenting with different design creations of websites.
