# Content Insights 

This week I learnt what child themes are, and how they work. A child theme is used to modify all aspects of a website from looks to functionality, To change the look of the website you have to use CSS and create your own CSS file to overwrite the parent theme. This week I also learnt what stand up meetings are, and how they can help with team communication and direction for a projects. A stand up meeting is a great way to understand how a team is progressing, and to define what the next steps are in the project. 

# Career/employability/Learning Insight
Regular meetings during the completion of our group project will be beneficial in keeping all team members accountable for their own section of work. Which means that the work should be split evenly between all members of the group.
