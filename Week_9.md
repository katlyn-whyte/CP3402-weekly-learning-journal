Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet) is a preprocessor language that is compiled into CSS. Sass provides Css with different ways to make the sheet more efficient.

Sass uses different functionalities, such as;
- Variables = allows you to store values such as colour.
- Nesting = allows you to style elements in the same class, e.g. navigation.
- Mixins = allows you to reuse style blocks of code.
- Importing = allows you yo import content from one Sass file to another.

Sass files have to be compiled into CSS for the browser to interpret. Unlike CSS, Sass can not interpret the code, it must be compiled to CSS before browsers can apply it.


# Career/employability/Learning Insight
When coding I find that the CSS stylesheet can be very long and get confusing when trying to find the section I want to edit. using Sass will be very useful as it will split up the different sections into their own file, making it easier to find.
