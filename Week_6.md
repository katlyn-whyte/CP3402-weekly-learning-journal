# Content Insights 

This week I learn't about different roles that are given to each member of a team during agile meetings. These include Scrum master, talker and sitters. A scrum master should divide the group into their perspective roles, a sitter is someone who is interested in the topic, but are not expected to speak. Talkers are people who are expected to contribute to the team. The layout of the meeting is important as it physically separate talkers and sitters from each other, making it easier for the scrum master to keep the meeting agile. Furthermore, their are four different types of agile meetings, these include; sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospective meetings.

# Career/employability/Learning Insight

It is important to use a variation of different agile meetings to keep the team on track with goals and tasks. I think it is important for all meetings to have similar roles to agile meetings, so that all team members in the group can have time to voice their opinions, goals and issues without being interrupted. This would be very helpful as sometime I loose my train of thought when I am interrupted half way through a point. By implementing these roles, it will help with my communication to my team members, but also my understanding of what others are saying.
