This week I learn't about different PHP constructs and elements that are commonly used in software development. 

Variables in PHP always start with $. Letters, number and underscores are permitted in the name conventions but the second character can not be a number. Variables are case sensitive and can not contain spaces or hyphens. ($FirstName, $First_Name)

Decisions in PHP are either using conditions or comparisons. Like the comparisons in python they are used to determine if something is true and the next action that occurs afterwards. Some comparison operators in PHP are different in python such as identity comparison. In python is and not is, is used to determine if objects are the same. In PHP === is used to see if 2 variables are identical. Include is a very helpful code construct as it can reuse the same .php file on different pages such as header and footer.

PHP  can be used to connect to a MySQL database, where data can be retrieved and then using PHP to work with that data  ($sql = "SELECT * FROM _____";)





# Career/employability/Learning Insight

This Week I learnt that I have to change the amount of time that I allocate to study. Lately I have found that I have not been finishing the amount of study that I should be doing in the time allocated. I feel that my productivity during my study time has decreased as the trimester has gone on. To improve my study sessions, I will allocate more time to study during the week and to keep the sessions shorter and more frequent then longer.
